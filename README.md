# Dhamma Notes

I would be seriously surprised if anybody reads this, and uses this content. For now, it's just my own ego-trip of trying to put up notes on how to access the Dhamma. This is just the result of my own transformation, not truth exposed.

## Principles

A manifesto in progress, from the bottom of my dhamma-teacher-wannabe inflated ego... I'm so gonna be acclaimed for this one day.


1. **True Buddhism is a fiction**

  Exact words for translation don't exist  
  nothing is wrong except what leads to suffering  
  there is no normative Buddhism  

2. **Wrong Buddhism is real**.

  tons of bad stuff available

3. **Buddhist concepts are not truth, they have a function**. They do not describe reality, they help you discover what it is, what it isn't, what it neither is or isn't.

  skillful means  
  upaya  
  function of making your mind ache  
  function of questionning our logic and perception  

4. **Contradictions are food for the transformation of the mind, which is full of them already**.

5. **You can totally evaluate what's good for you, but you should not trust yourself**.

  consumerism  

6. **It's ok to be wrong for some time**, as long as you know you're wrong but you don't know how to not be wrong properly.

  too much reading kills the fun  
  don't read the end of the book first  

7. **Nobody likes a smart-ass, but everybody wants to be one**.

  tolerance for everything  
  don't be too confident about what you find in books  
  don't judge too fast
