**By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:**
- ...

**Sati** is the seventh component of the [Noble Eightfold Path](lesson_XX_magga.md).

- Right View (samma ditthi)
- Right Intention (samma sankappa)
- Right Speech (samma vacca)
- Right Action (samma kammanta)
- Right Livelihood (samma ajiva)
- Right Effort (samma vayama)
- Right Mindfulness (samma sati)
- Right Concentration (samma samadhi)


> « (i) sati remembers or does not lose what is before the mind ; (ii) sati is, as it were, a natural ‘presence of the mind’ ; it stands near and hence serves and guards the mind ; (iii) sati ‘calls to mind’, that is, it remembers things in relationship to things and thus tends to know their value and widen the view ; (iv) sati is thus closely related to wisdom ; it naturally tends to seeings things as they truly are. » [Gethin 2001 p. 44]

Satipatthana : sati+patthana ET sati+upatthana
Causing mindfulness to stand near, to come into service

_"Sati is understood as a quality of mind that ‘stands near’ or ‘serves’ the mind ; it watches over the mind."_ [Gethin 2001]

_"The four satipatthanas are, then, four anupassanas, four activities the purpose of which is to bring sati into ‘service’. That is, in the process of watching the body, feelings, mind and dhammas, sati stands near, manifests and is established."_ [Gethin 2001]

_"watching the body, etc, is what supports mindfulness, is what causes mindfulness ‘to stand near’, but at the same time the very nature of mindfulness is ‘to stand near’ or ‘to support’."_ [Gethin 2001]


> Abdhidhammakosa 432 : « On account of it [i.e. wisdom] mindfulness stands near, therefore wisdom is the standing near of mindfulness -- because of designating what has been seen [by wisdom]. »

Sati = to remember, to have in mind

Sati as one of the [five faculties](lesson_XX_matikas.md): faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom.

> "And **where, bhikkhus, is the faculty of [sati] to be seen?** The faculty of [sati] is to be seen here **in the four establishments of mindfulness**" [Samyuttanikaya V, 48.8, trans B.Bodhi pp 1670]

> "And **what, bhikkhus, is the faculty of [sati]?** Here, bhikkhus, the noble disciplie is mindful, possessing supreme mindfulness and discretion one who **remembers and recollects what was done and said long ago**."  
> "Here, bhikkhus, the noble disciple is mindful, possessing supreme mindfulness and discretion, one who remembers and recollects what was done ans said long ago. **He dwells contemplating the body in the body... feelings in feelings ... mind in mind... phenomena in phenomena**, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful and having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world."  
> "The [sati] **that one obtains on the basis of the four establishments of mindfulness**. This is called the faculty of mindfulness." [Samyuttanikaya V, 48.9-11, trans B.Bodhi pp 1671]



Sati = Dénombrer

> Milindapanha 37-8 : sati – calling to mind : « sati, when it arises, calls to mind dhammas that are skilful and unskilful, with faults and faultless, inferior and refined, dark and pure, together with their counterparts. »
sati – sélection, « taking hold » : « sati, when it arises, follows the courses of beneficial and unbeneficial dhammas : these dhammas are beneficial, these unbeneficial, these dhammas are helpful, these unhelpful. »

Sati est apilapanata : not floating on the object of the mind, does not allow any floating, plunges into it.

## Relationship with wisdom (panna)

### Sati leads to wisdom

Sati comme un moyen d’accès à la « Prajna », parmis les trois moyens d’accès au Dhamma : l’enseignement oral/lecture, l’analyse, la contemplation.
Accès au Dhamma, à la théorie, mais de quelle théorie on parle ?
5 aggrégats d’appropriation, 12 facteurs de coproduction conditionnée
impermanence (anicca), souffrance (dukkha), non-soi / pas d’essence (anatta).
Les 4 nobles vérités
…
Rapport entre théorie et pratique : trop de théorie freine la pratique, la pratique pour la pratique ne permet pas forcément d’acquérir les bonnes ditthi (ah oui ?)

[Gethin 2001] pp. 41-42 : lien avec sanna, perception, remembering the sign, see things as they truly are, and wisdom
[Gethin 2001] « sati should be understood as what allows awareness of the full range and extend of dhammas ; sati is an awareness of things in relation to things, and hence an awareness of their relative value. »
« sati is the mental quality that submerges itself in the objects of the mind ; when there is no sati the mind floats or drifts on the objects of the mind. »
MOOC : comprendre par l'expérience, la nature de l'esprit, qui est maléable et plastique

### Wisdom leads to sati

[Sharf 2014] « Traditional forms of Theravada meditation required proficiency in the categories and methods of abhidhamma analysis. »

## Relationship with ethical conduct (sila)

### Ethical conduct leads to sati

[Gethin 2001] p. 43 : « In effect this conception of sati suggests that the stronger the quality of mind called sati becomes, the weaker unwholesome states of mind become, and the harder it is for these to take over and dominate thought, word and deed. »

[MOOC] : si l'esprit est maléable, si on se rend compte par la méditation à quel point nous sommes plastiques, flexibles, et que nous pouvons nous changer, la question des valeurs devient essentielle car elle conditionne la direction dans laquelle nous allons nous emmener, les critères qui vont déterminer les pratiques que nous choisirons, consciemment, de prendre.
=> notre responsabilité, in fine, est-ce que l'on veut être conscient ou pas ? Changer ou pas ? Quelles pratiques décidons-nous d'emprunter ?

### Sati leads to ethical conduct

[Sharf 2014] « There is little ‘bare’ about the faculty of sati, since it entails, among other things, the proper discrimination of the moral valence of phenomena as they arise. »
Ainsi, attention à ne pas considérer Sati comme une « expérience indicible »
[Sharf 2014] « In Theravada abhidharma, consciousness and the object of consciousness emerge codependently and are hence phenomenologically inextricable. That is to say, the objects of experience appear not upon a preexistent tabula rasa, but rather within a cognitive matrix that includes affective and discursive dispositions occasioned by one’s past activity (karma). »

>  Mahaparinibbanasutta (DN16) :
« Voici comment un bhikkhu vit en ayant lui-même pour île, lui-même pour refuge, sans avoir d'autre refuge; en ayant le Dhamma pour île, le Dhamma pour refuge, sans avoir d'autre refuge. Que ce soit maintenant ou une fois que je serai parti, tous ceux qui vivront en ayant eux-mêmes pour île, eux-mêmes pour refuge, sans avoir d'autre refuge; en ayant le Dhamma pour île, le Dhamma pour refuge, sans avoir d'autre refuge, sont ceux qui sont les plus éminents, pourvu qu'ils aient le désir d'apprendre.»

Pas un rapport supérieur à l’éthique, mais une mise à l’épreuve personnelle. Comment ? par les Satipatthana.

### Mil3.1.13 - Milindapañha - Characteristic marks of sati

_[Translation](https://suttacentral.net/en/mil3.1.13): The Questions of King Milinda, translated from the Pali by T.W. Rhys Davids. Prepared for SuttaCentral by Bhikkhu Sujato._

> The king said: ‘What, Nāgasena, is the **characteristic mark of mindfulness** ?’  

> ‘**Repetition**, O king, and **keeping up**.’  

> ‘And **how is repetition the mark of mindfulness**?’  

> ‘As mindfulness, O king, springs up in his heart he repeats over the good and evil, right and wrong, slight and important, dark and light qualities, and those that resemble them, saying to himself: “These are the four modes of keeping oneself ready and mindful, these the four modes of spiritual effort, these the four bases of extraordinary powers, these the five organs of the moral sense, these the five mental powers, these the seven bases of Arahatship, these the eight divisions of the Excellent Way, this is serenity and this insight, this is wisdom and this emancipation.” Thus does the recluse follow after those qualities that are desirable, and not after those that are not; thus does he cultivate those which ought to be practised, and not those which ought not. That is how repetition is the mark of mindfulness.’  

> ‘Give me an illustration.’  

> ‘It is like the treasurer of the imperial sovran, who reminds his royal master early and late of his glory, saying: “So many are thy war elephants, O king, and so many thy cavalry, thy war chariots and thy bowmen, so much the quantity of thy money, and gold, and wealth, may your Majesty keep yourself in mind thereof.’

> ‘And **how, Sir, is keeping up a mark of mindfulness**?’

> ‘As mindfulness springs up in his heart, O king, he searches out the categories of good qualities and their opposites, saying to himself: “Such and such qualities are good, and such bad; such and such qualities helpful, and such the reverse.” Thus does the recluse make what is evil in himself to disappear, and keeps up what is good. That is how keeping up is the mark of mindfulness.’

> ‘Give me an illustration.’

> ‘It is like the confidential adviser of that imperial sovran who instructs him in good and evil, saying: “These things are bad for the king and these good, these helpful and these the reverse.” And thus the king makes the evil in himself die out, and keeps up the good.’

> ‘Well put, Nāgasena!’
