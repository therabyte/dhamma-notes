# Lesson 1 - Introduction [wip]

**By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:**
- name some reasons to start meditation
- name the different categories of meditation practice and provide examples for each

## Why Meditate?

What meditation can do:
- achieve **well being**: understanding yourself, reduction of stress, general better health
- develop **awareness**: develop a clarity of mind, be more aware to your relatives and interactions, avoid fragmenting your attention, better focus without forcing yourself
- be able to **detach yourself**: does not mean run away from problems, but not be overwhelmed, not be controlled by them, meditation will help you look back, look objectively, and get in control
- favor **ethical conduct**: be aware of the suffering you inflict yourself, and the suffering you inflict others, avoid to make others suffers, be more kind and attentive to others, learn moderation of mind
- in a **general buddhist framework**: a way to the cessation of suffering, by knowing your "self"<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>, by the understanding of the nature of "reality"<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>
- in a **secular framework**: meditation has an experimental value in what looks like a "science of the mind", it's a way to challenge your conceptions on the nature of self, to analyze the nature of things

What medication cannot do:
- Nobody becomes a hero by meditation. It **does not give super powers**. You don't become an exceptional and unique being, especially because meditation is a way to deflate ego.
- It **will not cure a serious disease**... but it can ease the suffering, the pain or the fear related to this disease, and thus can help you fight against it by relieving their influence on you.
- Not really sure it can really help in cases of serious depression, aggravated psychosis or any severe mental trouble.

Besides, beware of applying too much psychology into it. Psychology has been developed in a completely different cultural context. If your motivation stays on a psychological level (well being, problems to solve with your relatives, etc), it will work to some extent but you may not be receiving the fruits of a true transformation of the self.

_"The purpose of Buddhism is not stress relief. Buddha did not teach a method to help busy executives survive better in the rat race."_, David Brazier, ["It Needs Saying"](http://www.tricycle.com/blog/it-needs-saying), Tricycle, May 30 2015

On some level of understanding, meditation does not, ultimately, solve our individual problems (big or small), because it let us see how we are not just one individual. And if we're clinging to being one individual, it may distract us from the real and beneficial practice. (In short, it's not about yourself, when your self cease to exist).


## What are we talking about?

Not one meditation, or "the" meditation, but a collection of various techniques, more of less complex, with various objectives and functions, drawn out of different theoretical or cultural frameworks. Their labels are not consistent and solid across literature.

Examples of labels you'll find:
- samatha = mental calm, stillness of the mind
- vipassana = insight, deep vision
- samadhi = absorption of the mind
- MBSR + MBCT = clinical / therapeutic and lay version of meditation used in hospitals
- ...

More "buzz" now that it was years ago, so expect lots of crap. Be aware that this transforms your mind, more of less gently (usually very gently). Do not use extreme meditative practices without any kind of serious and well-recognized non-cultish guidance.


## What you should know

It's a life long thing. It's going to take time. Yes, you can see results very quickly. But soon you'll get frustrated, only to discover some time later a huge progress, and then plateau again and get frustrated. It's perfectly normal and frustration should be expected by everybody.

It strongly depends on your commitment, your motivation, why you practice, and how you discipline yourself.


## Notes

<a name="footnote1">1</a>: some terms like "self" and "reality" should be used with caution in a buddhist background, cause ultimately, well, they "neither exist nor do not exist", that's what these quote and quote are for.
