#### Rationale

...

#### Protocol

1. Breathe out through your right nostril.  
  That way, imagine you're breathing out the mind, that you can picture as a white smoke leaving through your right nostril, making a loop, and then breathing in through your left nostril. **Count 1.**
2. Do the same in the other direction: breathe out the mind - white smoke - from the left nostril and visualize it making its way back when you breathing in through your right nostril. **Count 2.**
3. Do the same but this time, breathe out through both your nostrils and breathe in through both, visualising your ming leaving and reentering this way. **Count 3.**

Repeat 1,2,3 until you reach the count of 21. When you've reached 21, start over at 0.

If you lose track, or if you fail counting in any way, or if you got carried away by some random thoughts, you start over by counting at 0. The goal here is concentration, training the ming to be calm (shiné).


#### Notes

You might have a tendency to name each breathing in/out, to count each breath consciously by spelling it out in your mind. It's ok, the goal here is concentration. If that counting disturbs you too much, you can try picturing the number breathed out with the mind (walking on the white smoke) and breathed in with the mind again. The number and the mind make one.
