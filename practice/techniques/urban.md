# Urban Practices of Lean Meditation

or _"how to look like a weirdo in town"_

One key difficulty in sustaining practice is to integrate it in your daily life. We never have time, we never know when to do it. But if we look more closely at some of our daily activities, there's plenty of room to meditate! Just look at all the spots in your schedule when you're stuck, when you're doing nothing specific. Identify typical activities you do everyday, and to transform them as meditation practice rituals. A few examples below.


## Walking pace in the street or workplace

* time: flexible
* source: personal

#### Rationale

Interesting exercise when you're going to a meeting, or when you go to work, or back home. It's surprising how we walk usually way faster than we really need.

#### Protocol

Used when walking on the street (ex: to go to work) or in the office (ex: going to a meeting, going to lunch).

Focus on your speed, your pace, how your feet go one after the other.

Is it fast? slow?  
Is it maybe too fast? is there any real important need to be _that_ fast ?  
Or is it too slow? like you just seem too chill and not serious enough?

Now, try to bring your pace toward some "neutral" pace.  
One that would be neither fast nor slow, neither rushed nor chill.  

If some random thoughts occur, while gently bringing your mind back on the observation of your pace, see how those thoughts have changed your pace.  
Did you get faster? slower?  

More specifically, what thoughts make you speed up?  
Is it because you have an important meeting (but you're not late at all) ?  
Is it because you have the impression people think you're not looking busy enough ? (especially in the workplace, everybody want to look busy)  
Do you really need to walk that fast?

Your answers are all yours to contemplate.


## Breathing at the supermarket

* time: flexible
* source: personal

#### Rationale

It's the end of the day, you've bought a few things at the supermarket for cooking tonight. You're in a rush or whatever. And of course there's a huge queue at every single cash register. No way around that.

What did you expect? Everybody has to buy stuff at the same hour of the day. And this happens probably every single evening at the same hour. But this gets you angry anyway.

If you're into math, you might even start to compute which queue would be the shortest one, depending on how many people there are, what kind of caddy they have, etc.

And it might make you very angry at random people you don't even know, because they're too slow, because they're old or can't find change in their purse. That's how horrible we can get in the supermarket.

So, this is the perfect moment to learn patience and practice mild loving kindness. Cause there's nothing else to do anyway.

#### Protocol

The idea is pretty simple: just wait and observe.

I suggest starting by focusing on your breath to get some mental calm. A couple of times, count your breath in and out, up to 10. If your thoughts wander, gently go back to your breath like you would in a [sitting Anapanasati meditation](anapanasati.md).

If you have to wait longer than that, while still focusing on your breath, observe the people around you. In your queue or the others.

Look at what products they buy. Would you have bought the same products?  
Maybe they get also nervous or angry? Would you have been angry too?  
Observe their attitude and compare it to what you would have done in the queue.  

If something happens before you - someone taking more time than expected, someone exchanging a few comments with the cashier - use that opportunity to observe what emotional reaction it does to you.

You can also use that time to meditate on how you're just the same as everybody else.

Force yourself to do that every time you encounter a queue, whether it's in the supermarket, at the post office, or even at the DMV (yeah, seriously). Take it as an opportunity to practice. Being stuck in the queue is offering you some spare time in your day to practice your mindfulness.
