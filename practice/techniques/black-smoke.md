## Black Smoke breathing

- time: 5 mins
- type: [samatha](../../docs/vocabulary.md#samatha), [shiné](../../docs/vocabulary.md#shiné)
- source: [gelougpa](../../docs/vocabulary.md#gelougpa) temple in Paris

#### Rationale

...

#### Protocol

Simple breathing:
- as you breathe out: imagine you're breathing out negativity by picturing it as a black smoke loaded with negative thoughts
- as you breathe in: imagine you're breathing in positivity, a quality you draw from your environment

Repeat 5 mins.

#### Notes

This "negativity" is chosen, identified, imagined before the exercise. You identify the type of negativity you want to reject (anger, fear, stress, pain...), and you apply the exercise picturing it as black smoke.

Probably a more general practice coming from elsewhere...
