#### Protocol

> "At the end of the day, one pictures oneself the acts one has felt, the thoughts one has had. The examination operates retrospectively, [that is from the last minutes of the day to the first]. The facts the most insignificant must be recalled as equally as the most important ones, because the goal of this exercise is to train ourselves to let nothing clear away from the things our senses have felt, or from the ideas that have crossed our mind."
