# Taking Refuge [pali version]

_NOTE: Each school/sect of Buddhism will have it's own version. This corresponds to a pali/theravada setting._

## Rationale

In a **Buddhist** setting, you _"take refuge"_ at the beginning of a practice session. It definitely has a **devotional** aspect (see [discussion](#discussion)), but devotion can help the practitioners feel more confident about their practice, and get into a peaceful state before practicing.

But it's also a practice in itself, as it is a tricky **exercise of concentration** and you can take it just like that. Reciting the text by heart without mistake requires some attention for a beginner, and is thus a good way of setting your mind up for practice.

Of course, the translation in English is weird and nobody agrees on it, as usual.


## Protocol [wip]

_"Je vais vers le Bouddha comme refuge..."_

Alternatively, you can recite the pali version:

> Buddhaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi  
> Dhammaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi  
> Saṅghaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi  
> Tudiyampi Buddhaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi  
> Tudiyampi Dhammaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi  
> Tudiyampi Saṅghaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi  
> Tatiyampi Buddhaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi  
> Tatiyampi Dhammaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi  
> Tatiyampi Saṅghaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi

DN 26, Cakkavatti.Sihanada sutta
trad. B. Bodhi, p395

> "Monks, be islands unto yourselves, be a refuge unto yourselves with no other refuge. Let the Dhamma be your island, let the Dhamma be your refuge, with no other refuge."

How?

> "Here, a monk abide contemplating the body as body, ardent, clearly aware and mindful, having put aside hankering and fretting from the world..."
