## Relevant Extracts

### MN 18 - Madhu­piṇḍi­ka­sutta

« [Danpadani the Sakyan] asked the Blessed One : 'What does the recluse assert, what does he proclaim ?'

'Friend, I assert and proclaim [my teaching] in such a way that one does not quarrel with anyone in the world with its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, in this generation with its recluses and brahmins, its princes and its people ; in such a way that perceptions no more underlie that brahmin who abides detached from sensual pleasures, without perplexity, shorn of worry, free from craving for any kind of being.' »

> Note from B. Bodhi, « MA quotes in this connection SN 22:94 'Bhikkhus, I do not dispute with the world, it is the world that disputes with me. A speaker of Dhamma does not dispute with anyone in the world.' [...] The second part may be taken to mean that for the aharant, perceptions no longer awaken the dormant underlying tendencies to defilements, to be enumerated in §8. »

« [A certain bhikkhu asks] 'But, venerable sir, how does the Blessed One assert and problaim [his teaching] in such a way […]'

'Bhikkhu, as to the source through which perceptions and notions [born of] mental proliferation [papañ­ca­saññā­saṅ­khā] beset a man : if nothing is found there to delight in, welcome and hold to, this is the end of the underlying tendency to lust [rāgā], of the underlying tendency to aversion [paṭi­ghā], of the underlying tendency to views [ditthi], of the underlying tendency to doubt [vici­kicchā], of the underlying tendency of conceit [mānā], of the underlying tendency to desire for being [bhava­rā­gā­], of the underlying tendency to ignorance [avij­jā­] ; this is the end of resorting to rods and weapons, of quarrels, brawls, disputes, recrimination, malicious words, and false speech ; here these evil unwholesome states cease without remainder.' »

> B. Bodhi : « Nanananda explains papanca as 'conceptual proliferation' […] The commentaries identify the springs of this proliferation as the three factors – craving, conceit, and views – on account of which the mind 'embellishes' experience by interpreting it in terms of 'mine', 'I', and 'my self'. » reference to MN 1 mannana

Kaccana later explains this extract to the bhikkhus :

« Dependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact [phasso]. With contact as condition there is feeling [vedanā]. What one feels, that one perceives [sañjānāti]. What one perceives, that one things about [vitakketi]. What one thinks about, that one mentally proliferates [papañceti]. With what one has mentally proliferated as the source, perceptions and notions [born of] mental proliferation [papañ­ca­saññā­saṅ­khā] beset a men with respect to past, future, and present forms cognizable through the eye. »
+ ear, nose, tongue, body, mind
MN 133

> B. Bodhi : « This passage shows how papanca, emerging from the process of cognition, gives rise to perceptions and notions that overwhelm and victimise their hapless creator. »

> « feeling and perception are inseparable (MN 43.9) »

> quoting Nm : « What is perceived as 'this' is thought about in its differences and is thus diversified from 'that' and from 'me'. This diversification – involving craving for from, wrong view about permanence of form, etc. and the conceit 'I am' – leads to preoccupation with calculating the desirability of past and present forms with a view to obtaining desirable forms in the future. »

« When there is the eye, a form, and eye-consciousness, it is possible to point out the manifestation of contact [phasso].

When there is the manifestation of contact, it is possible to point ou the manifestation of feeling [vedana].

When there is the manifestation of feeling, it is possible to point out the manifestation of perception [sanna].

When there is the manifestation of perception, it is possible to point out the manifesation of thinking [vitakka].

When there is the manifestation of thinking, it is possible to point out the manifestation of besetment by perceptions and notions [born of] mental proliferation [papañ­ca­saññā­saṅ­khā­].

When there is the ear… the nose… the tongue… the body… the mind [mana]…

When there is no eye… it is impossible to…

When there is no ear… no nose… no tongue… no body… no mind [mana]… »


### MN 11 – Cūḷa­sīha­nāda­sutta

« 'But, friends, is that goal for one affected by lust [rāga] of free from lust ?' […] 'free fom lust'

'Friends, is that goal for one affected by hate [dosa]… affected by delusion [moha]… affected by craving [tanha]… affected by clinging [upadana]…
Friends, is that goel for one who has vision [viddasuno] or one without vision ? … for one who favours and opposes, or for one who does not  favour and oppose ? …

'But, friends, is that goal for one who delights and enjoys proliferation, or for one who does not delight in and enjoy proliferation ?' Answering rightly, they would answer : 'Friends, that goal is for one who does not delight in and enjoy proliferation, not for one who delights in and enjoys proliferation.' »

« Bhikkhus, there are these two views : the view of being [bhavadiṭṭhi] and the view of non-being [vibhavadiṭṭhi]. Any recluses or brahmins who rely on the view of being, adopt the view of being, accept the view of being, are opposed to the view of non-being. Any recluses or brahmins who rely on the view of non-being, adopt the view of non-being, accept the view of non-being, are opposed to the view of being.

Any recluses or brahmins who do not understand as they actually are the origin, the disappearance, the gratification, the danger and the escape in the case of thes etwo views are affected by lust, affected by hate, affected by delusion, affected by craving, affected by clinging, without vision, given to avouring and opposing, and they delight in and enjoy proliferation. They are not freed from bith, ageing, and death ; from sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair ; they are not freed from suffering, I say. »
